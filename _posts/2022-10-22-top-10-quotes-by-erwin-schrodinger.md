Some famous quotes by Erwin Schrodinger.

## 1

> The task is not to see what has never been seen before, but to think what has never been thought before about what you see everyday.

## 2

> The total number of minds in the universe is one.

## 3

> The present is the only thing that has no end.

## 4

> We must not wait for things to come, believing that they are decided by irrescindable destiny. If we want it, we must do something about it.

## 5

> Quantum physics thus reveals a basic oneness of the universe.

## 6

> Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.

## 7

> Multiplicity is only apparent, in truth, there is only one mind.

## 8

> We do not belong to this material world that science constructs for us. We are not in it; we are outside. We are only spectators. The reason why we believe that we are in it, that we belong to the picture, is that our bodies are in the picture. Our bodies belong to it. Not only my own body, but those of my friends, also of my dog and cat and horse, and of all the other people and animals. And this is my only means of communicating with them.

## 9

> No self is of itself alone.

## 10

> Science cannot tell us a word about why music delights us, of why and how an old song can move us to tears.
