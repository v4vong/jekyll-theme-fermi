Some famous quotes by Enrico Fermi.

## 1

> Before I came here I was confused about this subject. Having listened to your lecture I am still confused. But on a higher level.

## 2

> There are two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis, then you've made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you've made a discovery.

## 3

> Experimental confirmation of a prediction is merely a measurement. An experiment disproving a prediction is a discovery.

## 4

> Never underestimate the joy people derive from hearing something they already know.

## 5

> Where is everybody? Humans could theoretically colonize the galaxy in a million years or so, and if they could, astronauts from older civilizations could do the same. So why haven't they come to Earth?

## 6

> It is not good to try to stop knowledge from going forward. Ignorance is never better than knowledge.

## 7

> Whatever Nature has in store for mankind, unpleasant as it may be, men must accept, for ignorance is never better than knowledge.

## 8

> Some people stick with the traditional, feeling struck by the epic beauty or blown away by the insane scale of the universe. Personally, I go for the old "existential meltdown followed by acting weird for the next half hour. But everyone feels something.

## 9

> I remember my friend Johnny von Neumann used to say, "with four parameters I can fit an elephant and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk."

## 10

> The fact that no limits exist to the destructiveness of this weapon [the "Super", i.e. the hydrogen bomb] makes its very existence and the knowledge of its construction a danger to humanity as a whole. It is necessarily an evil thing considered in any light. For these reasons, we believe it important for the President of the United States to tell the American public and the world what we think is wrong on fundamental ethical principles to initiate the development of such a weapon.
